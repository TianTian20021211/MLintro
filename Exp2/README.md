### Code Execution Guide

- The code in the file is categorized by modules, and you can run it directly in sequence.
- In the sections where parameters are modified to observe changes, due to changes in the overall data volume and adjustments in the code execution order, dimension mismatches may occur during actual execution.
  - In such cases, you only need to go back and run the corresponding parts in the second section of the code to make the dimensions match.
