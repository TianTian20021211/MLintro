# How to Run the Code

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: All the code is in the `hw1.ipynb` file.
2. **Follow the Sequence**: The code sequence follows the order of the titles in the report and code file.
3. **Configure Python Libraries**: Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed.
4. **Run the Code**: Directly run the `hw1.ipynb` file.
5. **Data Folder**: The `my_data` folder contains variables that will be saved when the code is run. This is intended to speed up future calls without needing to recalculate.
