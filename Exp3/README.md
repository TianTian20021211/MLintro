## Code Execution Guide

​	The `dataProcess.ipynb` file contains the code for data preprocessing. The files `BaggingSVM.ipynb`, `BaggingDecisionTree.ipynb`, `AdaBoostSVM.ipynb`, and `AdaBoostDecisionTree.ipynb` contain the corresponding code for the four models.

​	The execution logic is as follows: first, run the data preprocessing code to generate feature vectors, and then run the model-specific code.

​	Since I stored the code locally on OneDrive, to save space, the preprocessed data is stored in an absolute path. To reproduce the results, you will need to modify the final storage path of the data in the data preprocessing section and accordingly adjust the initial data reading path in the model-specific code.
